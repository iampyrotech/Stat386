## Introduction
Hi, I'm **Chase Nielsen** — an Applied Statistics & Analytics student at BYU with a focus on **quantitative finance, data science, and investment research**.  
I love building things that analyze markets, explain risk, and make decisions smarter. Whether it’s venture capital, equity factors, or crypto portfolios, I’m most at home working at the intersection of **statistics, finance, and technology**.

I’m currently a **quant analyst**, early-stage fund researcher, and dashboard builder who enjoys solving hard problems with data.

## Get to Know Me
Outside of data and finance, I’m usually outdoors or building something.  
A few things I’m into:

- Backcountry skiing and mountain adventures  
- Truck restoration (currently rebuilding an ’87 Ford F-250)  
- Snowmobiling, biking, climbing, fly fishing  
- Guitar & music  
- Crypto markets, factor research, and quant strategy design  

**Fun fact:** I once built a crypto dashboard, ran a marathon, and rebuilt a 460 big-block engine — all in the same semester.
